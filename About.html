			<h1>About The Photographer</h1>
			<p>I'm Aries Jade Ambrocio, also known as AJ Pampanga. I am a freelance photographer based in Pampanga. I am also a teacher/coach in
				Pampanga State Agricultural University. You'll be able to see me around the university, mostly going in and out of the multipurpose center.</p>
			<p>My passion for photography goes beyond just taking pictures; it's about creating art that resonates with the soul.
				Each image I capture is a reflection of my dedication to my craft and my commitment to capturing life's most precious moments.</p>
			<p>Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and capture the moments that matter most.</p>
